# Pedal Master
![demo.gif](demo.gif)

A feet operated micro-keyboard design. Now, you can use digital
piano/synthesizer pedals to control your keyboard!

## Motivation
The primary use-case for this is to use pedals to hold modifier keys
such as CTRL, SHIFT and ALT while operating an ordinary keyboard
normally.
For an in-depth explanation of the motivation behind this project, see
[this page](motivation.jpg).

See the
[blogpost](https://ligature.ca/the%20lab/2021/10/29/Writing-code-using-a-foot-pedal.html)
for an overview of the design process.
